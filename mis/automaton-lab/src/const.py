message1 = """Welcome to Automaton Lab.!
We study about automaton in there, here is the space of "Rule 30"[1] automaton.
We breed 15 cells automaton now, they are ring-connected -- they are connected the first cell and the last cell.
Our interest is what this cute automaton grow up in future, we want your help to expect their growth.
[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_30

For example, now automaton state is "100000100000001" ('1' is alive and '0' is dead) and in next generation they are "010001110000011".
generation\tstate
0\t\t100000100000001
1\t\t010001110000011
2\t\t011011001000110

We give you initial state(init) and generation(gen). You write down the state of this automaton of the nth generation in binary.
Are you ready?
